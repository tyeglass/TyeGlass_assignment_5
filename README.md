# TyeGlass_assignment_5
This project comprises three small Python programs that each utilize loops to solve distinct problems.
Each challenge demonstrates a different kind of logic and looping structure.
 - Challenge 1: Number Sequence Generator
I used a while loop because the number of repetitions isn’t known in advance.
The program keeps running until the number becomes 1, so a while loop fits perfectly.
How it works:
The user enters a starting number and the program prints the sequence by:
Dividing even numbers by 2.
Multiplying odd numbers by 3 and adding 1.
It continues looping until the number reaches 1.
The total number of steps is counted and displayed.
 - Challenge 2: Prime Number Checker
I used a for loop because the range of possible divisors (from 2 up to the number minus 1) is known in advance.
How it works:
The user enters a number and the program checks each possible divisor in order. If one divides evenly, the number isn’t prime, and the loop stops early using break. If no divisor is found, the number is prime.
 - Challenge 3: Multiplication Table
I used nested for loops because both the rows and columns have fixed ranges (1 through 10).One loop handles the rows, and the inner loop handles the columns.
How it works:
The top row and left column display numbers 1–10 and each cell shows the product of its row and column. Tabs (\t) are used for simple alignment.
 - AI Assistance
I used ChatGPT (OpenAI) to:
Help write clear explanations for the README.
give me detailed instructions on how to make git commits.
